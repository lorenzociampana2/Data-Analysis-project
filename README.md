# Data-Analysis-HouseMarket-Project

The repository contains a project made by me and 4 colleagues for a university project of the "Data Analysis for Business" class. The project aims at identifying the best deals and strategies to take for rental agencies to maximise profits in the Brazilian House Market. On the other hand, We also analyzed good deals for mid-income households. Factors such as the city, the area and the home furnishment have been analyzed to accomplish so.

The dataset used for this project can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rubenssjr/brasilian-houses-to-rent. The RMarkdown and the complied HTML version contain the most relevant findings of our analysis. Hope you enjoy!
